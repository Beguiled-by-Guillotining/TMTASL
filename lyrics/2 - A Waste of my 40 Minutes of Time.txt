All right now if we start with this semi-review attempt.
you might as well just enjoy it while its there.
If you don't like my review, don't read it.

The whole anime is a message to gamers.
This actually disgusted me.
Anyway, no more to say about it.

beautiful. literally beautiful art.
It will get you into the right mood.
But that is only in this matter.

Characters. Ah chars!
The most "NORMAL", so to speak, would be the President.
He just wanted to be a hero to humanity.
he is saddened by everything.
even the tsundere girl gives in to his demands.
they both suck as human beings.

You're saying that it's based on a visual novel and that they removed many important things compared to the novel ? Well, who cares ! i didn't read the visual novel so i don't care !
Someone explain to me why the hell did they start.
Why oh director WHY?

The sound... kamisama, THAT'S DELICIOUS !!
it has literal food.
Like eating pizza, getting sauce all over your face, laughing, getting ice cream for the first time in your life.

a waste of my 40 minutes of time.
