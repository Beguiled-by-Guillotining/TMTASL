I chucked on a random anime just to kill the silence.
known as the Hulk of Animation.
I was in for quite the kicker.
a weird turn into unhealthy obsession which I find creepy.
The embodiment of panty and pantyhose fetish.

I was a different person back then.
I thought that the most childish thing in the world was a child that was still inside your mother's belly.
It's honestly just sad.
in fact, multiple times me has gone against her judgement and came out a better man.
go full speed and either die leaving atmosphere as a falling start in revers or crashing.

it is possible to suddenly fail and psychologically collapse from one moment to the next.
would highly not recommend it.
it certainly tries at times to justify its existence.
it just became annoying.
I'd rather kill myself in this war than be killed in it.
